This folder contains input files to test your program.
You may modify these files or add your own - they are purely for debugging.

Each JSON file contains a dictionary with input parameters to your program.
For example:
    {
        "requests": [
            "10:00am, 30", 
            "10:15am, 45", 
            "11:00am, 20", 
            "11:15am, 60", 
            "12:30pm, 60", 
            "1:00pm, 75"
        ]
    }

To test your program using the JSON file run:
    ./answer ./inputs/small_input.json

This calls schedule_with_lunch() in answer.c as follows:
    schedule_with_lunch(requests)
