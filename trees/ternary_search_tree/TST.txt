Applications of ternary search trees:
1. Ternary search trees are efficient for queries like “Given a word, find the next word in dictionary(near-neighbor lookups)” or “Find all telephone numbers starting with 9342 or “typing few starting characters in a web browser displays all website names with this prefix”(Auto complete feature)”.

2. Used in spell checks: Ternary search trees can be used as a dictionary to store all the words. Once the word is typed in an editor, the word can be parallely searched in the ternary search tree to check for correct spelling.
