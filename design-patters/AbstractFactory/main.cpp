The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows clients to create objects without knowing their concrete types, promoting loose coupling between client code and the actual implementation classes. Let's explore this pattern in detail with an example:

Example: GUI Library
Suppose we are developing a GUI library that supports multiple platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Each platform has its own set of UI components like buttons, checkboxes, and text fields, but the client code should be able to create these components without knowing the underlying platform details. We can use the Abstract Factory pattern to achieve this.
