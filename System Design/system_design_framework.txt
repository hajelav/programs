4 step framework

Step 1 : Spend 5 mins

    1) Gather functional requirements
    2) Gather non functional requirements
        2.1 Security
        2.2 Consistency
        2.3 Performance  -> Imp
        2,4 Scale -> Imp
        2.5 Availibility -> Imp

Step 2 : 15 mins
    1) API design : come up with some high level API , as to how the ends user will
    interact with your system. Use RestAPI schema

    2) Propose a high level design with all major components. Come up with a high level 
    design diagram.

    3) Data model : define the schema and some tables to store the data. You can always 
    start with relational DB schema.
        3.1 Discuss data access patters ( more read heavy or write heavy)
        3.2 Read/write relational

Step 3 : Deep Dive (20 mins)
    Work with the interviewer to discuss the area which needs to be deep dived. In this section
    discuss the non functional requirements and how to tackle specific challenges

Step 4: Wrap up 5 mins
    Summarize your design
